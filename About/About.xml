	<description>Version 3.0
Adds an automated spotlight that lights the target area up in a small radius.
When enemies come in range, the spotlight 'fires' and the target becomes lit, increasing the chance of hitting the target for your pawns and turrets.
It's got a range of 50 tiles, slightly further than any handheld weapon.
Uses the same clunky AI a vanilla improvised turret has.

Auto Spotlight:
Power draw: 50W standby, 550W active
Research requirement: Electricity, GunTurrets
Cost to make: 70 stuff, 80 steel, 2 components</description>
